The first step is synthesis para nitro benzoic. It performs in 250mL three-neck flasks, adds the para-nitrotoluene of 0.05 mol and relative It is 5% 4 bromides and 50mL distilled water in the molar fraction of para-nitrotoluene. Then, a reflux condensing tube, thermometer, and stirring are installed to open the stirring; after the temperature is increased to 90 degrees, it is divided into some parts 0.125 mol KMnO4, and the reaction temperature is 90-95 degrees. The stirring reaction is 2.5 hours.

Room temperature is cooled to by reaction solution, which filters out the solid, and the filter cake is hot washed two times. The filtrate merges, is acidified to PH=2-3, separates out the solid, and is filtered, cold water washing the filter cake through dry pale yellow crystals of par nitrobenzoic acid.

The second step is the synthesis of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate. It performs that adding 0.015 mol par nitrobenzoic acids in a single neck round-bottom flask of dry 100 mL, 25 mL absolute ethyl alcohols, the 2.5mL concentrated sulfuric acids, the heating stirring backflow reaction 1.5 hours in water-bath will be anti-answer liquid to pour into the beaker equipped with 100 mL frozen water, separate the crystal, suction filtration, the filter cake is transferred in a small beaker after washing 2 times with water, add 10 mL water soak, and it is 5% sodium carbonate solution that masses fraction is added under agitation, and regulation PH value of solution obtains faint yellow solid pair to 8 ethyl nitrobenzoate.

The third step is the synthesis of benzocaine. It performs that by adding 1.95 grams of ethyl p-nitrobenzoates and 100mL in 250mL round-bottomed flasks. The solution that ethanol is made adds 0.02 gram of Pd/C catalyst, is passed through a hydrogen stirring reaction, and a TLC monitoring reaction is tied until the reaction Beam, using diatomite Filtering of the catalyst, is spin-dried to remove ethanol, and obtains the final product white ethyl aminobenzoate.
